# Marketing your integration

When getting the word out about your integration, your marketing must follow Adobe's branding guidelines.

We want you to be able to promote your integration while protecting Adobe's corporate and product brands and trademarks. For details, make sure to read the [Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Brand Guide](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf).

The brand guide includes best practices for using Adobe brand assets in marketing, press releases, and social media, and is the best spot to get our most up to date assets. You’ll also find information for how to publicize and promote your integration once it’s approved by the Creative Cloud Integrations Review process.
