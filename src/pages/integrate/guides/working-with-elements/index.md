# Introduction to Library Elements

Creative Cloud Libraries are made up of elements which represent design ingredients.

Elements include things like colors, fonts, graphics, and videos. Elements contain metadata, thumbnails, and `renditions` (static graphics). Some contain different `representations`, which are versions of graphics in different formats.

The following guides provide insight into how to access, create, and manipulate Library elements via the API.

- [Supported Elements](./supported-elements/) - Creative Cloud Libraries supports a wide range of element types. This section provides an overview of the element types supported as well as detailed information on the most common element types including:
  - [Graphics](./supported-elements/#graphics)
  - [Color](./supported-elements/#color)
  - [Gradients](./supported-elements/#gradient)
  - [Character Styles](supported-elements/#character-style)
  - [Paragraph Styles](./supported-elements/#paragraph-style)
- [Creating Library Elements](./creating-elements/) - This section describes how to create a Library Element, including creating the element metadata and then uploading the representations of the element.
- [Accessing File Formats](./accessing-file-formats/) - This section describes how to access different versions of an element via `renditions` and `representations`.
- [Element Validations](./element-validations/) - This section provides information on the validation rules that are used when creating or modifying elements.
