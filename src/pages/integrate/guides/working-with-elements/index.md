The following guides provide insight into how to access, create, and manipulate library elements via the API.

- [Supported Elements](./supported-elements/) - Creative Cloud Libraries supports a wide range of element types. This sectiong provides an overview of the element types supported as well as detailed information on the most common element types including [Graphics](./supported-elements/#graphics), [Color](./supported-elements/#color), [Gradients](./supported-elements/#gradient), [Character Styles](supported-elements/#character-style), and [Paragraph Styles](./supported-elements/#paragraph-style).
- [Creating Library Elements](./creating-elements/) - This section describes how to create a Library Element including creating the element metadata and then uploading the representations of the eleement. 
- [Accessing File Formats](./accessing-file-formats/) - This section describes how to access different versions of an element via `renditions` and  `representations`.
- [Element Validations](./element-validations/) - This section provides information on the validation rules that are used when creating or modifying elements.
