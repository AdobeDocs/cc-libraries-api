# Supported Library Element Types

This document provides detail on currently supported library element types; the amount of information
here should be enough to get started creating any of these types, however, it may not, in certain circumstances,
be completely comprehensive. This document assumes general familiarity with Libraries and the element
creation process.

The element types are:

| Name                    | MIME Type                                        |

## Graphics

### Element Type

application/vnd.adobe.element.image+dcx

### Description

Represents any still image.

### Allowed Representation Types

The set of types that is allowed is quite expansive, and changes frequently. This includes common image types, file
formats specific to different Creative Cloud applications, and, in certain contexts, types we can convert to images, including
things like PDFs, Word documents, etc. However, the most common types are:

- image/gif
- image/jpeg
- image/jpg
- image/png
- image/svg+xml

### Representation Requirements

- if the primary representation is not a bitmap, a fullsize bitmap rendition that can be used for thumbnails
- optionally, other renditions depending on what apps may consume the image

### Example Payload

```json
{
  "name": "my-cool-image",
  "type": "application/vnd.adobe.element.image+dcx",
  "client": {
    "deviceId": "MY_COOL_DEVICE_ID",
    "device": "MY_COOL_DEVICE",
    "app": "MY_COOL_APP"
  },
  "representations": [
    {
      "type": "image/svg+xml",
      "relationship": "primary",
      "storage_href": "https://cc-api-storage-stage.adobe.io/assets/adobe-libraries/4dc522a7-af3d-4274-986c-bb1f59bb20d0/3f4d2883-f7e5-4d64-bec1-f153ae5d80af"
    },
    {
      "type": "image/png",
      "relationship": "rendition",
      "storage_href": "https://cc-api-storage-stage.adobe.io/assets/adobe-libraries/4dc522a7-af3d-4274-986c-bb1f59bb20d0/ec13e4e1-1c56-4d84-89ad-8df52f42ae8a"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Color

### Element Type

application/vnd.adobe.element.color+dcx

### Description

Represents a single color.

### Allowed Representation Types

#### application/vnd.adobe.color+json

Every color representation requires a property named "color#data", the value of which is a JSON structure
that represents the color. This structure may have the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                                                              | Required                                | Values                                                                                      | Default Value                              |

'value' will change depending on 'mode' as follows:

| Mode      | Default profileName       | Value                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The different color "types" are as follows - note that all colors require the process values for the color mode, even if they're of a non-process type, so that they're supported in apps that only understand process colors.

| Type         | Additional Properties                                     | Description                                                                                                                           | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none         |                                                           | A "none" color is used in print to mean "don't apply any ink"                                                                         | None colors should set the process values to 0% with alpha 0 (e.g. CMYK 0,0,0,0, alpha 0)                                                                                                                                                             |

This is the default type of color. | Note: Even if a color has type other than process, it must still include a value for the color based on the table above. (e.g. CMYK must always have c, m, y, k fields).                                                                              |
| registration |                                                           | A registration color is used in print to mean "apply all the inks" (e.g. 100% process colors plus 100% of any spot color).            | If the type is “registration” – apps that understand this will interpret as a registration color, otherwise will use the process values. Registration colors should set the process values to 100%, with alpha 1 (e.g. CMYK 100,100,100,100, alpha 1) |
| spot         | "spotColorName": Name of the spot color (catalog + name). | A spot color is used in print to mean a specific ink (e.g. using a Pantone color), rather than mixing inks.                           | The spotColorName property holds the name of the catalog and color of the spot color, e.g. "Pantone Metallic Gold 875"                                                                                                                                |

#### Swatches

Swatches should contain an array of exactly 5 arrays. Each array contains objects in the format defined for
Color that are all representations of the same color and must include at least one RGB representation. The primary
representation of any single color will always be at index 0 in the array.

### Representation Requirements

- A application/vnd.adobe.colortheme+json primary representation.

## Gradient

### Element Type

application/vnd.adobe.element.gradient+dcx

### Description

Represents a collection of colors (color stops), combined with some algorithm for interpolating between them.

### Allowed Representation Types

application/vnd.adobe.gradient+json

You may also encounter a representation type of "application/vnd.adobe.gradient.noise+json",
which represents a _noise gradient_. This is a custom gradient type used by Photoshop as a mechanism
to represent textures; this gradient type contains additional fields to the ones below.

## Character Style

### Element Type

application/vnd.adobe.element.characterstyle+dcx

### Description

Represents a collection of styles that may be applied to characters within some text.

### Allowed Representation Types

#### application/vnd.adobe.characterstyle+json

Every representation of type "application/vnd.adobe.characterstyle+json" should contain a property
named "characterstyle#data". The value of characterstyle#data should be a dictionary containing at least
one property. Each of these properties should represent a style.

There are three categories of styles: standard CSS styles, with the name in camelCase instead
of kebab-case, e.g. "lineHeight" instead of "line-height"; internal styles that are valid across multiple
adobe applications, the names of which will be in camelCase and prefixed with "adbe', e.g., "adbeFont";
and, internal styles only valid within a single application, which are typically prefixed with "adbe"
followed by an abbreviation of the application name and then the style name, e.g.,
"adbeIlstOpenTypePosition" for a style only valid for Adobe Illustrator. Styles in this third
category may change frequently depending on application-specific requirements.

For any style that may have an enumerated value, the value will just be a string, e.g., {"fontStyle": "italic"}.
For any style that may require a list of items, the value should be represented as an array,
e.g., {"fontFeatureSettings": \["aalt", "liga", "flac"\]}. For any style that is measured with
some css unit, the property value should be a dictionary containing a "type" and "value" property
that separate these components, e.g., "56vm" would be represented as {"value": 56, "type": "vm"}.
Additionally, most styles will have their own special requirements.

Due to the variety of constraints within each style, application-derived interrelationships between
styles, and, the possibility that some will change over time in accordance with application-specific
requirements, it may be helpful to try prototyping character styles within a Creative Cloud app first, before
attempting to create them _ex situ_.

Some frequently used styles:

#### application/vnd.adobe.indesign-idms

A character style may also be represented as an InDesign snippet.

## Representation Requirements

- A mandatory application/vnd.adobe.characterstyle+json representation, which may have the primary relationship,
  or the rendition relationship, in the case where an InDesign snippet is used as the primary.
- Optionally, a primary representation of type application/vnd.adobe.indesign-idms, if the json representation is not primary.
- A mandatory thumbnail rendition, e.g, of type "image/png".

## Paragraph Style

### Element Type

application/vnd.adobe.element.paragraphstyle+dcx

### Description

Represents a collection of styles that may be applied to paragraphs.

### Allowed Representation Types

#### application/vnd.adobe.paragraphstyle+json

This representation type is almost identical to application/vnd.adobe.characterstyle+json,
except that the set of styles that are considered valid is a superset including all valid
character styles alongside a set of styles that are only valid for paragraphs.

Some frequently used paragraph styles:

### Representation Requirements

The requirements are identical to the character style element, except an application/vnd.adobe.paragraphstyle+json
primary or rendition representation is expected instead of an application/vnd.adobe.characterstyle+json element:

- A mandatory application/vnd.adobe.paragraphstyle+json representation, which may have the primary relationship,
  or the rendition relationship, in the case where an InDesign snippet is used as the primary.
- Optionally, a primary representation of type application/vnd.adobe.indesign-idms, if the json representation is not primary.
- A mandatory thumbnail rendition, e.g, of type "image/png".

### Example postLibraryElement Payload

```json
{
  "adbeParaAlignment": "Alignment.CENTER_ALIGN",
  "adbeLeftIndent": { "type": "pt", "value": 12 },
  "adbeHyphenateWordsLongerThan": 10,
  "adbeHyphenation": true
}
```
