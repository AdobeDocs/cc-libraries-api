# What are Creative Cloud Libraries?

Before you start, it's worth quickly orienting yourself to [Creative Cloud Libraries](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/libraries.html).

Creative Cloud Libraries are accessible across all of Adobe's tools and offer a powerful way to organize logos, colors, and other assets so they can be easily re-used and accessed. Using the API, you can let Creative Cloud users access their Libraries and add new content to their Libraries right from within your products and services.

Creative Cloud Libraries are made up of _elements_ that represent different asset types. Examples of _elements_ include _Graphics_, _Character Styles_, _Colors_, and many more. Each _element_ contains the information that represents that asset, which is different for each _element_ type, as well as a thumbnail to represent the asset and some other metadata.

_Elements_ in a Library can be organized by type or by _groups_, which are defined by the user and are tied to a given Library.

Libraries are primarily associated with a single user, the owner, and are considered `private`. But users may have access to _Shared Libraries_ (`incoming`), they may have shared Libraries they own (`outgoing`), or be following a _Public Library_ (`public`). All types of Libraries can be accessed via the API.
